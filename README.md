# Full-Stack E-Commerce Web App

This is a simple full-stack e-commerce website built with **React**, **Vite**, **MongoDB**, **Express**, **HTML**, and **TailwindCSS**. The site displays products from a MongoDB database, allows users to add items to a shopping cart, and provides a responsive UI with persistent cart data using local browser storage.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AjayLokesh/ecommerce-app
cd ecommerce-app
```

### Back-End Setup
```bash
cd back-end
npm install
npm run dev
```
Make sure to update app.js to connect to your MongoDB URI.

### Front-End Setup
```bash
cd ../e-commerce
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

# Data Persistence
The cart state is stored in the browser using localStorage, so even if the user closes or refreshes the page, their cart items will still be there when they return.
